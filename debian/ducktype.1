.SH NAME
ducktype \- convert Mallard Ducktype to Mallard XML
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBducktype\fR [\fB--output\fR=\fIOUTPUT\fR|\fB-o\fR \fIOUTPUT\fR] \fIINPUT\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBducktype\fR(1) tool converts Mallard Ducktype, a lightweight
markup language for topic-oriented help, into Mallard XML.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-output=\fIOUTPUT\fR, \fB\-o\fR \fIOUTPUT\fR
Set the output file or directory name. The default is to take each input
pathname, remove any \fB.duck\fR suffix and append \fB.page\fR. If there
is exactly one input file, \fIOUTPUT\fR may be a filename. Otherwise,
\fIOUTPUT\fR must be a directory name, and files will be created in that
directory instead of in the same directory as the input.
