= Verbatim Test

[note]
  [code]
    This is in code in a note.
      So is this, and it's indented.

    This is still in the code at the original indent.

      This is indented after a line break.
        This is indented even further.

    This is no longer indented.
  This is no longer in the code, but still in the note.
